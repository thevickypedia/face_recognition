# Face Recognition
Face recognizing script using OpenCV

Face recognition is one of the challenging tasks when it comes to models like 
>CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks<br>
>HOG - Histogram Oriented Gradients<br>
>SIFT - Scale Invariant Feature Transform<br>

It all depends on how many images you train your model with and how good/bad is the acceptance/tolerance level. 

#### Note:
For the type of images I used, I found the model 'hog' to be best with 0.6 learning rate. However these values can alter based on various factors.
